Dotfiles are configuration files on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, etc.) that customize how programs and the shell behave.

They’re called dotfiles because their names start with a period (.), which makes them hidden by default. For example:

~/.bashrc – settings for the Bash shell

~/.zshrc – settings for the Zsh shell

~/.vimrc – settings for Vim

~/.gitconfig – Git configuration

Many developers keep their dotfiles in a Git repository (often named dotfiles) so they can version them and sync their environment across multiple machines.

In short, dotfiles are the personal configuration scripts that define your development environment.
